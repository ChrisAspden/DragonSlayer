# DragonSlayer

This a simple c# game where you play as a barbarian and are trying to kill the dragon.

It follows the conventions of a simple turn based rpg, each time you attack the dragon will counter attack.

I have created a number of game mechanics to add some complexity (armour debuffs, excecute moves, healing spells).

The game finishes when iether you or the dragon die.
